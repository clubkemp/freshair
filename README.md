## Target User profile:
Outdoor activities and hiking enthusiasts who are constantly looking for new hiking trails and places to explore and enjoy the outdoors. Typically in their 20s to 40s technology savy individuals comfortable with new technology and want to obtain hiking outdoor data and information instantly.

## User Pain points: 
The inconvenience of having to go to multiple sources to obtain the hiking information and the nearby spots for beer and quick bites after hike. 

## App approach:
We are using the street map api to obtain the geo location of the user and then log the geo location to both hiking project and yelp site to collect the near by hikes and beer spots information.  

## User Journey:
Uses will download this app and immediately use the geo locate in their phone to identify their locations or the users can manually input the location of their choice. Once the location is loaded, it will show stack of cards of near by parks, hiking trails and bar/ restaurants for user to pick.
