#Project 1: Freshair Outdoor Map 

## Target User profile:
Outdoor activities and hiking enthusiasts who are constantly looking for new hiking trails and places to explore and enjoy the outdoors. Typically in their 20s to 40s technology savy individuals comfortable with new technology and want to obtain hiking outdoor data and information instantly.

## User Pain points: 
The main pain point we are trying to solve is during the Covid era and the need to be social distancing and stay away from the crowd. often times it is very difficult to obtain information regarding how busy hiking trails are. Very often the users only found out the trails are pakced when they arrive the trail head and feel no longer safe to hike with a large crowd. This app can facilate users to make decisions before heading out to hike and avoid going to the trails that are too busy and crowded to stay safe. 

## App approach:
We are considering using the snap chat map API which provides the active users' locations/activities to generate a heat map of where the crowds are, then we can overlap this heat map information with the park and recreation organization API to pull the information of near by parks/ trails that are less popular to help hikers decide where to go. 

## User Journey:
Uses will download this app and immediately use the geo locate in their phone to identify their locations or the users can manually input the location of their choice. Once the map is loaded, it will show the near by parks and hiking trails with visual heat map generated and showing areas with larger crowd and avoid going to those areas. Once the destination is determined, we can link in google map, bing map or apple map to show the driving directions.

## Additional eatures can be expanded in the future:
1. This app can also include a twitter like message board for hikers to post comments and updates on certain trails and conditions so it's constantly live updated to provide other hikers the information before they heading out.
2. This app can also expand to other outdoor activities such as cycling, boating, running, camping ect. This will provide other outdoor options besides just hiking.
3. Uses can also add secret spots they discovered and share with selected group of friends on their private borads.
